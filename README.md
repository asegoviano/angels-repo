# Project 1

## Cloud Security with Azure
For the Cloud Security Project Azure was used to create a virtual network, network security groups, and multiple virtualmachines. The VM's included 1 jumpbox, 3 Web VMs, and ELK server. The two networks created were the RedTeamNetwork and ELK-NET which were connected to allow the jumpbox machine to connect to the ELk server via ssh. Related files can be found in the following folders above: Ansible, Diagrams, and Linux.

# Project 2

## Final Project
In this project, you will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working.
If the alerts are working, you will then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, you will report back your findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.
