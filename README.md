## Cloud Security with Azure
For the Cloud Security Project Azure was used to create a virtual network, network security groups, and multiple virtualmachines. The VM's included 1 jumpbox, 3 Web VMs, and ELK server. The two networks created were the RedTeamNetwork and ELK-NET which were connected to allow the jumpbox machine to connect to the ELk server via ssh.
